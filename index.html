                    Our life starts with sports, and it is essential to keep our brain and body healthy. I love playing cricket.
                    In our country India, almost every sport is played, but the most popular of these is cricket, which is liked by the age group of young children to older men.
                    Whenever there is a big cricket match, the match is seen by thousands of people on big TV screens with full joy.
                    This is the only game that has so much fan following. Cricket games are played mainly in countries like India, Sri Lanka, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan, West Indies, etc.

                <p>
                    Football is also one of the world’s most popular games.
                    Football is played by two teams. Each team has eleven players. The game is played on a large rectangular-shaped grass field. There are two goalposts on both ends of the breadth of the field. Players pass the ball to each other by kicking or heading it into the opponent’s goalpost. The players have to play the game by kicking the ball and passing it to teammates. Only the goalkeeper can stop the ball with hands within a restricted area around the goalpost. The objective of the team is to score more goals than their opponent team. The team scores a goal when the ball passes the goal line. The game is played for two 45-minute halves, and the team which makes the most goals wins.

                    Basketball is a crew sport, where there are two teams of five players each. The game is also commonly referred to as hoops. The teams face each other in a court, which is rectangular.

                    The main objective of the game is to score by shooting the ball to the opponent’s basket or hoop. The hoops are mounted on a ten feet high pole. Each goal is worth two points; three points if scored from behind the three-point line.
